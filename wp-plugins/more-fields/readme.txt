Adds any number of extra fields in any number of additional boxes on the Write/Edit page in the Admin.

== Description ==

More Fields is a WordPress plugin that adds boxes to the Write/Edit page. These boxes contains input fields, so that additional (more) fields can be added to a post. For example, if you write about books, you can add a box where you can enter title and author, etc. The boxes can be placed either to the right or to the left on the Write/Edit page.

**Upgrading from More Fields 1.x?** Please follow the upgrade instructions (installation tab). Also note that the functionality to create Post Types has been moved to a stand alone plugin: [More Types](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/more-types/).

With More Fields you can:

* Add any number of boxes with any number of fields to the Write/Edit page.
* Add text, Web Forms 2.0/HTML5 fields, text area, wysiwyg, check boxes, radio buttons and select lists as your input fields.
* Add More Fields boxes to any defined post type (works perfectly with [More Types](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/more-types/))
* Create archives/feeds based on Custom field values with custom slugs
* Create boxes programmatically (from `functions.php`, from exported files or from within other plugins)

More Fields is part of a suite of plugins created to enhance the functionality of a vanilla WordPress installation. With [More Types](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/more-types/) you can create additional post types besides Pages and Posts, with [More Taxonomies](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/more-taxonomies/) you can create additional taxonomies besides Categories and Tags. More Fields works without the other plugins but interacts with them nicely.

This plugins was born out of the development work done for [Dagensskiva](http://dagensskiva.com/) and [Dagensbok](http://dagensbok.com/).

== Installation ==

To install More Fields:

1. Upload the 'more-fields' folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Administer in Settings -> More Fields

= Upgrading from More Fields 1.x? =

If you're upgrading from More Fields 1.x you need to make a couple of steps to continue working with your already defined Post Types and Fields.

1. Upgrade to More Fields 1.5.3 (this prepares the More Fields fields and Post types for WP 3.0)
2. Update to WordPress 3.0 still using More Fields 1.5.3
3. Upgrade to More Fields 2.0
4. Install More Types 1.0
