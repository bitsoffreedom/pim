- PDF generation (also decide which library to use);
- Save the Session state in the database;
- Create the administrative interface (Coen);
- Create a proper way to identify when a session has expired;
- Create a way to delete companies from the list.

Currently a race exists.

The Session state saves the following data:
- a list of sectors;
- a list of selected companies;
- More stuff which isn't relevant in this context.

These list point to rows in the database.

When the following happens the user would enter an unknown state.

- A user selects a sector (The Session state now has an entry which points to a database row)
- An administrator deletes this row from the database;
- The user continues with the next step but the reference isn't valid anymore.

A solution would be to store the Session state in the database and update it
atomically using transactions.
