PIM is a project which consists of a custom Django project and a Wordpress
instance with a custom theme.

Git revision control repository can be found here:

https://github.com/bitsoffreedom/pim

This repository holds both the Django project and the Wordpress theme.

STARTUP

We're using the FCGI django server which daemonizes itself. To start it go to
the following directory.

~/pim/

and run:

$ ./runserver.sh

UPGRADE

The checkout should be identical to the GIT repository. Only the configuration
files should be different (settings_local.py, hostname, port).

Please note that retrieving new updates from the repository updates both the
django instance and wordpress theme DIRECTLY. If needed take precautions.

To update the repository:

$ git pull

in the pim directory to get the latest version from git.

When the session handling has changed please truncate the django_session table.

When the model has changed please use ALTER TABLE to update the database tables
accordingly.

WORDPRESS

~/wordpress/wp-content/themes/

Holds the following symlink.

pim -> /data/WWW/pim.bof.nl/pim/wp-theme/
